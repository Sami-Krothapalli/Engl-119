The players arrived at the university and engaged in a series of challenges and battles. They used google to solve a Morse code puzzle and open a black box, gaining valuable contents and unraveling a rank-up riddle. Their journey led them to face an assassin, with Player 2 initiating the battle and stunning the assassin temporarily. Player 1 and Player 2 coordinated attacks, gradually wearing down the assassin's health while enduring retaliatory strikes.

Despite facing significant damage, both players strategically used healing potions to sustain themselves in the fight. Player 1's final blow with Hellish Rebuke weakened the assassin, allowing them to capture the foe using a clever blackjack tactic.

After escaping the university, Player 2, disguised as Professor Ghelan, ventured further and encountered guards. A skirmish ensued, resulting in Player 2 defeating the guards and earning experience points along with a dull spear.

Returning to interrogate the captured assassin, the players attempted to solve a riddle but failed after three attempts. This failure triggered a curse that caused the assassin's demise. However, they were able to loot valuable items from the assassin's possessions, including a specialized dagger, poison vials, a coded message, a signet ring, and gold coins.

Key GM Decisions:

1. Creating varied challenges: I designed a mix of puzzles, combat encounters, and role-playing scenarios to test the players' abilities and decision-making skills.
2. Introducing consequences for failures: The failure to solve the riddle within three attempts led to a significant consequence, adding tension and stakes to the narrative.
