The session began with the players in the bustling streets near the university, having just acquired the assassin's belongings. The discovery of Professor Ghelan's body and Laura's murder caused a stir, prompting the players to interview several witnesses:

1. Marie Clements, a nervous nobleman's daughter in a ballroom dress, provided limited information.
2. Carlos Rodriguez, an illegal exotic food trader, gave misleading information about the killer being a demi-human.
3. Tina Brooks' account aligned with Lucy Grant's and partially with Carlos, adding credibility to their observations.
4. Jamal Anderson hurriedly mentioned nothing substantial.
5. Derek Stone, posing as a merchant, was actually the killer but deceived with a fabricated story.
6. Fiona Zheng from the postal service mentioned seeing a man earlier.
7. Alexei Morozov, a food enthusiast, bought wyvern meat but was unhelpful overall.
8. Lucy Grant, a waitress, witnessed Laura arguing with a man wearing a signet ring, identifying Derek as the killer.

The players chose to confront Derek, leading to a battle where Sum Ting Wong and Kairon attacked him. Despite Derek's formidable attacks, the players managed to defeat him. Sum Ting Wong dealt the final blow, acquiring wyvern poison and the Nightshade Whisper from Derek's possessions.

The players impressively solved the riddle for the black box on their first attempt, ending the session with a successful resolution to their investigation.

Key GM Decisions:

1. Diverse NPC encounters: I created a range of witnesses, each with unique personalities and levels of cooperation, to add depth to the investigation.
2. Balancing combat encounters: I ensured that the battle with Derek was challenging yet manageable, allowing the players to emerge victorious while facing significant threats.
