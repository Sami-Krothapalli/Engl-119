They first focused on decoding a message from the assassins, which led to solving a  hexadecimal riddle. They then disguised themselves as guards for the duke were  they were then challenged by the other guards to solve riddles However, despite their efforts, they failed to answer both riddles and a Leetcode problem, resorting to bribing a guard with 50 gold coins to gain access to restricted areas.

The players successfully deciphered a hexadecimal code, which revealed the Duke's bedroom location. Utilizing Sumting Wong's abilities, they navigated through guards using Pass Without Trace and made their way to the royal map room. Although they managed to steal a map, their actions alerted the guards, resulting in a daring escape but also almost losing their items and facing a ban from the black market in Orario.

To replenish their resources, they traded wyvern poison for 800 gold coins in the black market and then stole it back from the guard where they were banned from Orario  so they went to the magic capital Alvarez and later won 1600 gold coins at a casino in Alvarez. With their newfound wealth, they purchased valuable items like Divine Restoration potions and lesser healing potions. After leaving Alvarez and arriving at Xandar, they ended the session.

Key GM Decisions:

1. Offering challenges with multiple solutions: I presented the players with puzzles, riddles, and decision points that allowed for various approaches, such as decoding, bribing, and strategic use of abilities.
2. Balancing risk and reward: I balanced the outcomes of their actions, rewarding successful endeavors like winning gold at the casino while also introducing risks, such as almost losing items and facing consequences like bans from certain areas.
