 They navigated through various rooms, encountered the Tarrasque and Shen, and ultimately confronted Magnus and the Masked Man, who turned out to be Shen.

The battle with Magnus and Shen was fierce, with Sum Ting Wong and Kairon dealing significant damage and facing deadly attacks in return. Despite their valiant efforts, tragedy struck as the Tarrasque was summoned and wreaked havoc, resulting in the deaths of the Duke, Laura, Sum Ting Wong, and eventually Kairon.

After the battle, Magnus offered a choice between the Elixir of Immortality and a Divine Restoration Potion to revive Shen. Sum Ting Wong chose the Elixir, leading to a final duel with Kairon. In a stunning turn, Sum Ting Wong emerged victorious but at the cost of Kairon's life.

The aftermath painted a somber picture as Sum Ting Wong grappled with the consequences of his choices. Despite gaining immortality, he found himself trapped in a life devoid of purpose, haunted by the memories of his actions and the loss of his companion. The Elixir of Immortality became a symbol of emptiness rather than the eternal life he sought, leaving him in a timeless prison of regret and isolation.
