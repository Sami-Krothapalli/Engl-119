In this session, the players arrived at Xandar and engaged in various encounters within the mines. They first interacted with a merchant to find the person who can lead them to the mines and then headed to the tavern, where they received a hint to find Garrick the guide. With Garrick's guidance, they stood before the door to the mines and attempted to solve a riddle multiple times before receiving hints that revealed the logic behind the door's detection mechanism.

During their attempts, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong sustained injuries, prompting them to use lesser healing potions to recover. With the final hint's insight, they successfully opened the door and entered room 1, where they defeated a skeleton and gained experience points along with a blessing that restored their health.

Continuing their exploration, they utilized teleportation to reach room 28, where they acquired various items such as shields, healing potions, and a locked teleportation crystal. Proceeding to room 47, they faced off against a formidable foe, the Lich, with medium difficulty. The battle tested their skills as they navigated through the Lich's attacks and spells, ultimately ending the session with the encounter ongoing.

Key GM Decisions:

1. Providing gradual hints: I introduced hints progressively to aid the players in solving the riddle, ensuring they had enough information to understand the door's mechanics without making it too easy.
2. Designing challenging encounters: I crafted the Lich encounter with diverse abilities and resistances to challenge the players strategically, offering a medium difficulty level suitable for their progression in the game.
