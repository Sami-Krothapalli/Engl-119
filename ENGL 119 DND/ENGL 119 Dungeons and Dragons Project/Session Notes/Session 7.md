**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of meteorite)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard

**Description:** You conjure a cascade of radiant starfire that descends from the sky and strikes a location you can see within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and 6d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
