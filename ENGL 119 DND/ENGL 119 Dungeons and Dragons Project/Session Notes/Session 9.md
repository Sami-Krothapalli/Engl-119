After the battle, Magnus, the Alchemist, harnesses his magical prowess to concoct the fabled Elixir of Immortality. However, as the potion nears completion, he faces a pivotal decision. There's only enough mystical essence left to craft either the Elixir of Immortality or a Divine Restoration Potion capable of reviving Shen from the brink of death.

**Sum Ting Wong's Choice:**

- **Elixir of Immortality:** A potion that grants eternal life and youth, a treasure beyond measure.
- **Divine Restoration Potion:** A rare concoction with the power to heal Shen, restoring him fully from the clutches of death.

In the heat of the duel, driven by desperation and conflicting ideals, Sum Ting Wong delivers a fatal blow to Kairon. The aftermath of this act is a profound silence, filled with the weight of irreversible loss and the stark finality of death.

As time progresses, Sum Ting Wong is left to navigate a life overshadowed by the choice he made. Despite possessing the Elixir of Immortality, promising eternal life, he finds himself engulfed in a life of emptiness. The immortality he sought and achieved becomes a constant reminder of the cost at which it came—friendship, trust, and the warmth of companionship.

He lives on, witnessing ages pass, friends and loved ones fading with time while he remains unchanged. The joy of life's fleeting nature, the growth, and the decay, the very essence of mortal experience, eludes him. Each day morphs into a mirror reflecting his isolation and the stark void left by Kairon’s absence.

Haunted by memories and what-ifs, Sum Ting Wong's existence becomes a paradox of life without living, immortality bereft of purpose. His quest for eternal life ultimately leads to a timeless prison of regret, where the legacy of his actions is a constant companion in an otherwise hollow eternity.
