Here's a riddle where "Secret" is the answer:

---

_"Whispered among many, yet heard by few,  
Held within hearts, away from view.  
More valuable when shared between two,  
Yet can grow in silence, in the shadows it brew.  
I can bind or break, or mend a rift,  
In my absence, many a friendship may drift.  
What am I, kept behind sealed lips,  
Guarded with care, lest it slips?"_

THEY GET THE AWNSER WRONG AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS

THE ASSIASN DIES

THEY LOOT THE ASSASIN

1. **Assassin's Dagger:** A finely crafted dagger with a black blade that seems to absorb light. It's lightweight and perfectly balanced, ideal for quick, stealthy strikes. Grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
    
2. **Poison Vials (3):** Small glass vials containing a potent paralysis poison. Can be applied to a weapon or used in traps, causing temporary paralysis to those failing a Constitution saving throw.
    
3. **Coded Message:** A scrap of parchment with a message written in a cipher. Deciphering it could reveal valuable information about the assassin's employer or next planned attack.
    
4. **Signet Ring:** A silver ring bearing the crest of a noble family, possibly linked to the Duke. This could serve as a key or a means of gaining entry or information from areas loyal to the Duke.
    
5. **Gold Coins:** A small pouch containing 50 gold coins, bearing the mint mark of the city's treasury. This money could be used to fund further adventures or purchase necessary supplies.
