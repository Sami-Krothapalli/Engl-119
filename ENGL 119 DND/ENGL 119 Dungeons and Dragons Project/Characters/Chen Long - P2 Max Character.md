## Chen Long's backstory:

- Chen Long was kicked out of his father's monastery after promoting the study of evil skills and methods, centered around the art of conning, stealth, and espionage.
- Long was originally meant to inherity this monastery, but not anymore.
- Long was taught these "evil" methods by his old master Shen, who was also kicked out of the monastery due to his suspicious teachings. He was essentially punished for corrupting the studies of the monastery. However, Long found utility in these teachings, which is why he continued to learn it.


## The connection between Chen Long and [[Kairon]]

- After Chen Long gets kicked out of the monastery, he does many pointless things such as small robberies and gambling before he finds a letter written by his master Shen.
- His master Shen had already passed away a long time ago, but in this letter, Shen passes his mission onto Long.
- Shen claims that there is an elixir of immortality that exists in a land far away from his monastery, and Shen's mission was to claim it.
- Shen had died on his search for this elixir, but he had written these letters in advance to Long, and his best friend, who coincidentally ended up being Kairon.
- It turns out that Shen was a half-tiefling, and he grew up with Kairon, before he joined the monastery.
- Shen had sent these letters to both Long and Kairon, who would end up meeting later and try to find this elixir together.

## The problem with Long's quest:

- Chen Long takes on this journey to find Shen's elixir of immortality only to acquire some kind of purpose in his life. Up until then, he had been committing petty crimes and gambling, without any kind of direction

- After Long eventually find this elixir, he realizes that taking it for himself would lead him to be in a constant search for new purposes in life, since his original journey had ended. Thus, resulting in a vicious cycle of life, switching between meaninglessness and meaning.
