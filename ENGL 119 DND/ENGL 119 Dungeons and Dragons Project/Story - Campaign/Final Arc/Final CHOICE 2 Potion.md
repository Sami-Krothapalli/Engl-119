**Event: The Duel of Fates**

In the aftermath of the Tarrasque's defeat, as the treasure lies scattered and the air thick with the power of untold magic, the tension between Sum Ting Wong and Kairos escalates to a breaking point.

**Kairos' Accusation:** Enraged by the impending choice of Sum Ting Wong, Kairos confronts him vehemently:

**Kairos:** "How dare you prioritize this potion over the life of my brother! Your greed blinds you to the bonds of comradeship and sacrifice!"

**Sum Ting Wong's Defense:** Sum Ting Wong, torn between the gravity of his decision and the urgency in Kairos' voice, replies:

**Sum Ting Wong:** "I understand your pain, Kairos, but we stand before a once-in-a-lifetime crossroad. This elixir could change everything, not just for me, but for all of us, for the entire realm!"

As words give way to fury, Kairos, consumed by grief and anger, challenges Sum Ting Wong to a duel, unable to accept any justification for neglecting his brother's life.

**The Duel:** The clash is immediate, a raw expression of grief and betrayal. Magic and steel collide, with each combatant showcasing their prowess:

- **Kairos:** Utilizes his skills as a fighter, channeling his rage into powerful melee attacks, perhaps enhanced by magical artifacts or spells gained during their adventures.
- **Sum Ting Wong:** Deploys his arcane knowledge, casting spells strategically to counter Kairos' physical onslaught, attempting to incapacitate rather than harm fatally.

**The Stakes:** The duel is not merely for honor or to vent anger; it's a manifestation of their underlying conflict over what they value most: the potential of eternal life or the immediate sanctity of a friend's life.

**Resolution:** The duel can end in various ways, depending on the intervention of other party members, the outcome of their combat, or a sudden realization or revelation that brings a halt to their conflict, leading to a deeper understanding or a tragic parting of ways.


Sumting wong kills kairon and explain how he lives with a life of emptiness

In the heat of the duel, driven by desperation and conflicting ideals, Sum Ting Wong delivers a fatal blow to Kairon. The aftermath of this act is a profound silence, filled with the weight of irreversible loss and the stark finality of death.

As time progresses, Sum Ting Wong is left to navigate a life overshadowed by the choice he made. Despite possessing the Elixir of Immortality, promising eternal life, he finds himself engulfed in a life of emptiness. The immortality he sought and achieved becomes a constant reminder of the cost at which it came—friendship, trust, and the warmth of companionship.

He lives on, witnessing ages pass, friends and loved ones fading with time while he remains unchanged. The joy of life's fleeting nature, the growth, and the decay, the very essence of mortal experience, eludes him. Each day morphs into a mirror reflecting his isolation and the stark void left by Kairon’s absence.

Haunted by memories and what-ifs, Sum Ting Wong's existence becomes a paradox of life without living, immortality bereft of purpose. His quest for eternal life ultimately leads to a timeless prison of regret, where the legacy of his actions is a constant companion in an otherwise hollow eternity.
