When the players reach the designated room, all doors instantly lock, leaving only one available path. As they proceed through the open door, they find themselves in a long corridor stretching before them, its length leading to an imposing white and gold door at the far end.

This grand door, adorned with intricate designs and shimmering with a subtle golden glow, presents a unique challenge: it features five key slots, each awaiting a different key, plus a special slot shaped for a stone key. To progress and face the final event of their adventure, the players must gather and use these keys, symbolizing the culmination of their journey and the trials they have overcome.


After the grand door swings open, the players confront Laura, the Duke, Magnus, and the masked man. The truth of Laura's affair with the Duke and the dark plot for immortality unfolds. The battle that ensues will be intense, and the true identity of the masked man is only discovered post-battle.


The KEY SLOTS:
	 1 Bronze Key    
    1 Silver Key
    1 Gold Key
    1 Platinum Key
    1 Stolen Necklace with a Key
    1 Mysterious Key of **Opening**
	1 Teleportation crystaly ( and 1 mysterious key of opening inserted)


DUKE: "HAHAHA my naive adventurers. I sought the elixir of immortality, a prize beyond mortal comprehension, and I needed the final piece of the puzzle — a piece you've so diligently secured for me. Magnus, with all his arcane knowledge, uncovered the path, but it was you who walked it, braving dangers and fetching what I needed most."


"Ah, the exquisite web of lies and deceit! It was Magnus, my loyal alchemist, whom I used to acquire the precious Ring of Regeneration and the Amulet of Health and the orb of lost souls. Two pivotal pieces in the grand tapestry of my eternal reign. And my beloved wife, oh, she played her part with such grace, ensuring my plans proceeded unhindered, all for the promise of becoming my eternal queen."

"NOW MY TOOLS KILL THEM"

**Magnus, The Alchemist:**

- **HP:** 180
- **Attacks and Spells:**
    - **Fireball:** 8d6 fire damage in a 20-foot-radius sphere.
    - **Cone of Cold:** 8d8 cold damage in a 60-foot cone.
    - **Chain Lightning:** 10d8 lightning damage, jumping to additional targets.
    - **Teleportation:** Can instantly move to a different location within 500 feet.
    - **Stone Shape:** Can manipulate earth to create barriers or weapons.

**The Masked Man (Paladin/Rogue):**

- **HP:** 150
- **Attacks and Abilities:**
    - **Divine Smite:** Adds 2d8 (or more) extra radiant damage to melee attacks.
    - **Assassinate:** Extra damage on surprised enemies.
    - **Poisoned Blades:** Adds 2d6 poison damage on a successful hit.
    - **Evasion:** Takes no damage on successful Dexterity saving throws against effects that normally deal half damage on a successful save.

Both individuals are formidable opponents, with the Alchemist specializing in high-damage magical attacks and the masked man (a paladin/rogue) excelling in melee combat and stealth attacks. The battle will be challenging, requiring strategic planning and resourcefulness from the players. Once they are defeated, the masked man’s identity as Kairon's brother is revealed, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative and emotional weight to the story.

**The Duke:**: Behold, the mightiest of beasts, bound to my will! With this power, I am invincible! Nothing can stand in my way now, not even you, my naive pawns!"

But the Tarrasque, a creature of pure destruction and chaos, acknowledges no master. Enraged by the summons, it turns on the Duke and Laura. The Duke's laughter morphs into screams of terror as he realizes his catastrophic miscalculation:

**The Duke (panicking):** "No! Obey me! I summoned you—I control you!"

His pleas are futile; the Tarrasque devours him and Laura in a display of its indomitable fury, leaving behind a scene of carnage.


**Tarrasque Stats:**

**Hit Points (HP):**  350

**Attacks:**

1. **Bite:**
    
    - **Attack:** +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
    - **Damage:** 4d12 + 10 piercing damage.
2. **Claw:**
    
    - **Attack:** +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the Tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
    
- **Multiattack:** The Tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail.
    
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the Tarrasque's choice that is within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.


Following the monumental defeat of the Tarrasque, the creature yields an extraordinary bounty:

- **Three Legendary Items:**
    
    1. **Crown of Dominion:** Grants the wearer the ability to command and charm creatures within a certain radius, enforcing their will as if they were a monarch.
    2. **Axe of Endless Conquest:** A battle-axe that deals extra damage and can summon spectral warriors to fight alongside the wielder once per day.
    3. **Cloak of the Planeswalker:** Allows the wearer to travel between different planes of existence at will and provides protection against planar environmental effects.
- **Treasure:**
    
    - 500 platinum coins, a small fortune signifying the wealth and power of the Tarrasque.

After the battle, Magnus, the Alchemist, harnesses his magical prowess to concoct the fabled Elixir of Immortality. However, as the potion nears completion, he faces a pivotal decision. There's only enough mystical essence left to craft either the Elixir of Immortality or a Divine Restoration Potion capable of reviving Shen from the brink of death.

**Sum Ting Wong's Choice:**

- [[Choice 1 Elixir]]
- [[Final CHOICE 2 Potion]]

The choice embodies a profound moral dilemma, weighing the allure of immortality against the immediate need to save a life, encapsulating the thematic essence of sacrifice and priority.
