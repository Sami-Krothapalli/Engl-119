### Decoding the Message and Infiltrating the Duke's Palace

After the intense battle with the assassin, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong focus on the cryptic message they found. The message, along with the insignia ring from the assassin, points them toward the Duke's palace.

**GM (setting the stage):** "With the assassin defeated and the immediate threat neutralized, your attention turns to the coded message and the ring bearing the Duke’s insignia. It’s clear that your next destination is the Duke's palace, a place of opulence shadowed by secrets."

GM: In the two messages you look at the page and u see nothing but dots

.. / -- / - .- .-.. .-.. / .-- .... . -. / .. / -- / -.-- --- ..- -. --. / .- -. -.. / ... .... --- .-. - / .-- .... . -. / .. / -- / --- .-.. -..

it Reads: I’m tall when I’m young and short when I’m old
Answer: Candle

The other coded message that is another morse code message 

.. / -- / .- / ... .... .- .--. . / .- -. -.. / .- -. / .. -. ... - .-. ..- -- . -. -

it reads I’m a shape and an instrument
Answer Triangle

you must decode the message (let they try to see that its morse code)

**GM (introducing the guild figure):** "As Kairon and Sum Ting Wong gather their gear, with the decoded message in hand they set there sights on going to the mines readying themselves for the journey ahead, a familiar shadow detaches from the evening gloom. The hooded figure of the guild emerges, his eyes glinting with unspoken knowledge."

**Guild Figure (speaking to the players):** "Your deeds have not gone unnoticed. The shadow of Laura's demise has been lifted, thanks to your courage and wit. The labyrinth you seek, however, is no mere set of tunnels; it's a dungeon of shifting paths and hidden perils. The key to navigating its treacherous turns lies within the Duke’s palace, in a secret room. You must infiltrate the palace, uncover this room, and obtain the map if you wish to unearth the truths buried deep within the mines." He provides you with a list in where it could be he also mentions that the rings you showed him seemed to have a secert inscription on it that is invisible to the naked eye it reads; **626564726F6F6D**

### Possible Rooms in the Duke’s Palace
1. **The Grand Library:** Filled with ancient books and possibly hiding the map among its rare cartographic collections.

3. **The Duke’s Study:** A personal space where private items are kept, possibly including the map.
    
4. **The Gallery of Ancestors:** A hall with family portraits and heirlooms, where the map could be hidden behind a painting or inside a ceremonial item.
    
5. **The Alchemical Laboratory:** Full of experiments and rare substances, the map might be locked in a puzzle box or a mysterious alchemical device.
    
6. **The Astronomical Tower:** An observatory with celestial guides, where the map could be disguised among star charts.
    
7. **The Duke’s Bedroom:** A private and luxurious chamber, likely guarded and containing personal treasures and secret compartments. The map might be hidden in a lockbox, behind a movable panel, or within the Duke’s personal safe, blending in with his most valued possessions.

**GM (guiding the players):** "Armed with this knowledge, you make your way to the Duke's palace. The ring with the Duke's insignia is a powerful symbol, offering you a guise of legitimacy. As you merge with the flow of guards at the entrance, one of them eyes you suspiciously and steps forward, his gaze fixed on your hands."

**Guard (inquiring the players):** "Your faces are unfamiliar, and every guard here wears a ring signifying their allegiance and rank. Show me your guard rings, or state your business immediately."

(Once the players show the rings, the guard's expression softens, but he remains cautious.)

**Guard (after seeing the rings, allowing entry but still cautious):** "Very well, you may enter. But know that the palace is a labyrinth of its own, full of eyes and ears. Since you are here, perhaps you can assist with something. I have a riddle that’s been troubling me, and I'd like to see if you're as sharp as you appear."

(Here, the guard presents the riddle to the players.)

**Guard (presenting the riddle):** "A box without hinges, key, or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid. What am I?"

(The players should respond with "Egg" to pass this subtle test of wit.)

**Guard (addressing another player with a coding question):** "Your companion handled the riddle well, but I wonder about the rest of you. Let’s see if you’re just as sharp. Consider this coding question

### PLAYERS MUST DECIPHER THE CODE ON THE RING

**GM (guiding the players through the discovery):** "After successfully deciphering the hexadecimal code hidden within the assassin's final message, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong realize it points directly to the Duke's private chambers. With stealth and caution, they navigate the opulent hallways of the palace, evading the guards' watchful eyes until they reach the ornate door of the Duke’s bedroom."

**GM (describing the Duke's bedroom):** "The door creaks open to reveal a lavish bedroom, bathed in the soft glow of moonlight filtering through gauzy curtains. The centerpiece is a grand, canopied bed, its linens made of the finest silk and embroidered with gold thread, suggesting a royal inhabitant's luxurious tastes. Across the room, a large, gilded mirror reflects the opulence, standing above a richly carved mahogany dresser. The air is scented with a blend of exotic perfumes and the faint, smoky aroma of incense."

**GM (highlighting the key objects):** "Near the bed, on a delicate nightstand, sits an elegant candle, its wax almost too pristine, as if it awaits a specific purpose rather than providing light. The room is filled with art and wealth, but your attention is drawn to an unusual, triangle-shaped shelf on the wall. It is an oddity among the otherwise symmetrical and lavish decor, crafted from dark wood and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, forming intricate geometric patterns."


## When the players figure out to place the candle in the triangle shelf

**GM (revealing the puzzle solution):**
As you lift the candle from the bedside and place it upon the triangle-shaped shelf, a subtle click echoes through the room. The shelf, responding to the weight of the candle, shifts slightly, triggering a mechanism that was hidden in plain sight."


**GM (unveiling the secret door):** "With a groan of stone on stone, part of the wall beside the shelf begins to move, revealing a narrow passage hidden behind what appeared to be a solid wall. The secret door stands open, inviting yet ominous, leading to the hidden depths of the Duke’s palace where the sought-after map
