### Short Description of the City Upon Players' Arrival

You arrive at your city and the first sight that captures your attention is the imposing Earthspur Mountain, its peak lost in the clouds, a known haven for a massive colony of dragons. The city, nestled at its base, is a marvel of architecture and dragon lore, its buildings adorned with draconic motifs. The skies above buzz with the activity of tamed wyverns and subdragons, providing a unique and swift mode of transportation for the city's inhabitants. The city's devotion to Asmodeus, the Dragon God, is evident in its temples and statues. The prevalent language here is Draconian, adding an air of mystery and challenge in communication for newcomers. The bustling markets offer a solution — a rune of communication, invaluable for those who wish to fully explore this majestic city.
