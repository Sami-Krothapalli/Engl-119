### Investigating Magnus's Belongings at the University with Alchemist Ghalen


The adventure continues within the dimly lit corridors of the university. Alchemist Ghalen and the players are making their way towards Magnus's last known location, his personal research office. The hallways are eerily quiet, with only the soft echo of their footsteps. Ghalen warns that guards patrol this area, though they are few and far between.

#### Scenario Introduction by Dungeon Master (DM):


**[Scene starts with Alchemist Ghalen and the players at the back entrance of the university.]**

**Alchemist Ghalen:** (Whispering) We must be silent and swift. There are guards everywhere that patrol this area,. Are you all prepared to enter?

**[Players indicate their readiness.]**

DM: As you follow Alchemist Ghalen through the shadowy university corridors, you approach a critical junction. Ghalen halts, pressing a finger to his lips. Ahead, the soft glow of lanterns and the muffled sound of conversation reveal a pair of guards on patrol. Ghalen whispers, "We must make a choice here—confront them or find a way to sneak past unnoticed. What do you wish to do?"

#### Encounter Options:

1. **Combat Option:** The players decide to engage the guards.
2. **Stealth Option:** The players attempt to sneak past the guards.

### ==Combat Option:==

**Ghalen:** (Nods) A direct approach, then. Let us prepare ourselves. Remember, teamwork is our strength. I can assist with minor spells to distract or weaken them. When you're ready, give the signal, and we strike together.

DM: As you decide to engage the guards, the tension in the air thickens. The narrow corridor offers limited space, forcing a confrontation that will rely heavily on strategy and quick thinking. Ahead, two guards stand side by side, casually patrolling the area. Their lanterns cast long shadows on the walls, their conversation a low murmur in the quiet of the night. Behind you, Alchemist Ghalen whispers an incantation, readying his magic to assist.

#### Guards' Positions:

- **Guard 1** stands closest to you, lantern in one hand, a short sword at his belt. He seems alert, yet unaware of your presence.
- **Guard 2** trails slightly behind, his focus more on the conversation than his surroundings. He carries a heavy club and a shield.

## Guard STATS:
- 30hp
- Can do 5 damage if the roll is odd else 0
- Killing them gives you 200 EXP Points


#### Alchemist Ghalen's Capabilities:

- **Minor Illusion:** Ghalen can create a sound or an image within range to distract one or both guards, potentially giving you the element of surprise. **(Roll a specific number distract both)**
- **Shield:** Once combat starts, Ghalen can cast _Shield_ as a reaction to protect a player from an incoming attack. can only be used once

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Excellent. Follow me closely. The traps within are designed to deter the uninitiated. Remember, the balance of nature and the symbols of the four elements are your guides through Magnus's defenses.

### ==Stealth Option:==

If the players opt for stealth: 

**Ghalen:** (Smiling) Ah, the art of subtlety. Let us blend with the shadows. If you have abilities or tools that can aid in our stealth, now is the time to use them. Otherwise, a careful roll of the dice will determine our fate. Shall we proceed?

#### Dungeon Master (DM) Introduction:

DM: Opting for subtlety over confrontation, you and Alchemist Ghalen prepare to navigate past the guards undetected. The corridor's shadows offer some cover, and the guards' attention seems fixed on their casual patrol route. Ghalen, familiar with the arcane arts, whispers a plan to cast a spell to aid your stealthy endeavor.

#### Alchemist Ghalen's Spell Options:

- **Silence:** Ghalen suggests casting _Silence_ on an area encompassing the guards, creating a 20-foot radius sphere where no sound can be produced. This spell would prevent the guards from hearing any noise you make as you move past them. (THIS SPELL ONLY ACTIVE IF ROLL IS A SPECIFIC NUMBER)

- **Pass without Trace:** Alternatively, Ghalen can cast _Pass without Trace_, a spell that veils you and your companions in shadows and silence, boosting your stealth with a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and making your tracks impossible to follow. [(IF THE D10 roll + 10 Dexterity  is above 24 then they can pass without a trace if not then they fight as the guards notice them)]

-  USE YOUR ITEMS: AND PASS THEM BUT ONCE YOU USE YOUR ITEM YOU LOOSE IT

#### Setting the Stealth DC:

DM: Given the guards' relaxed state and the advantageous conditions, the Difficulty Check (DC) for sneaking past them will be set at 24. Ghalen's spells can significantly aid your attempt, making detection much less likely.

#### Player Actions:

DM: Ghalen is ready to cast his chosen spell, looking to you for confirmation. _Silence_ will ensure no sound betrays your movement, while _Pass without Trace_ will cloak you in near-invisibility to prying eyes. Which do you prefer he casts or would you use an item?


### CONCLUSION

IF YOU FAIL TO TAKE DOWN GUARDS THE GUARDS TAKE GHALEN AND YOU GO UNNOTICED


#### Alchemist Ghalen's Reaction:

**Ghalen:** (Relieved) Well done, whether through force or finesse, we've made it past. Magnus's office is just ahead. Let's see what secrets it holds.

**[Ghalen leads the players through the entrance, navigating through dimly lit corridors filled with ancient artifacts and scholarly works and you Arrive at Magnus's Office.]**

**DM:** As Ghalen's hand turns the knob, the door creaks open, revealing the dimly lit office of Magnus. Books, papers, and strange artifacts fill the room, a testament to the alchemist's broad range of research. What you find here could very well change the course of your quest.

#### Dungeon Master (DM) Introduction:

DM: As you enter Magnus's office, a room filled with the scent of old books and the faint aroma of alchemical reagents, your eyes are drawn to the cluttered desk. Among the scattered papers and artifacts, a leather-bound journal stands out, its cover etched with intricate symbols that seem to pulsate with a hidden meaning. Alchemist Ghalen approaches, his eyes widening in recognition. "This... this is Magnus's personal research journal," he whispers, a note of reverence in his voice. "Be cautious; Magnus was known for his use of codes and ciphers to protect his work."


As you are about to open the journal u noticed that the page suddenly goes dark a bright flame appears and says the book  can only be opened by saying the magic words

THE WORDS: The brightest flame casts the darkest shadow

#### The Journal:

DM: The journal's pages are filled with notes on alchemical experiments, magical theories, and cryptic drawings. However, what catches your eye is a series of entries that appear to be written in a different hand—short, repetitive sequences that stand out against the detailed notes. It's clear this is some form of shorthand or code, designed to be unintelligible to the uninitiated.

#### The Code:
DM: You quickly realize that the sequences are not random; they are written in Morse code, a simple yet effective method of obfuscation. 
Here are a few entries you find:

1. **Entry 1:** ".- / -. . .-- / .-. . ... . .- .-. -.-. .... / .-.. .- -... --- .-. .- - --- .-. -.-- / .. ... / .... .. -.. -.. . -. / .. -. / - .... . / --- .-.. -.. / -- .. -. . ..."
2. **Entry 2:** "-- .- --. -. ..- ... / .... .- ... / -.. .. ... -.-. --- ...- . .-. . -.. / .- / .-- .- -.-- / - --- / .... .- .-. -. . ... ... / - .... . / . - .... . .-. . .- .-.. / . -. . .-. --. -.--"
3. **Entry 3:** "- .... . / -.. ..- -.- . / .. ... / .--. .-.. .- -. -. .. -. --. / - --- / ..- ... . / - .... . / .-. . ... . .- .-. -.-. .... / ..-. --- .-. / -- .- .-.. . ...- --- .-.. . -. - / . -. -.. ... / .- - / - .... . / --- .-.. -.. / -- .. -. . ..."


#### Task for the Players:

DM: To decipher the entries, you'll need to translate the Morse code. Each sequence holds vital information about Magnus's research, his discoveries, and perhaps most importantly, hints about his current whereabouts or the Duke's plans.

#### Deciphering Morse Code:

- **.-** translates to A
- **-...** translates to B
- **-.-.** translates to C
- **-..** translates to D
- **.** translates to E
- **..-.** translates to F
- **--.** translates to G
- **....** translates to H
- **..** translates to I
- **.---** translates to J
- **-.-** translates to K
- **.-..** translates to L
- **--** translates to M
- **-.** translates to N
- **---** translates to O
- **.--.** translates to P
- **--.-** translates to Q
- **.-.** translates to R
- **...** translates to S
- **-** translates to T
- **..-** translates to U
- **...-** translates to V
- **.--** translates to W
- **-..-** translates to X
- **-.--** translates to Y
- **--..** translates to Z


THEY OVERHEAR GUARDS COMING  IF THEY DONT SOLVE IT IN 20MINS THEY HAVE TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE DECIPHERED SO FAR or Risk being Caught

#### Decoded Entries (for DM's eyes only):

1. **Entry 1 Decoded:** "A new research laboratory is hidden in the old mines."
2. **Entry 2 Decoded:** "Magnus has discovered a way to harness the ethereal energy."
3. **Entry 3 Decoded:** "The Duke is planning to use the research for malevolent ends at the old mines."



## The Black Box in Magnus's Office

#### Dungeon Master (DM) Introduction:

DM: Among the items scattered across Magnus's desk, a peculiar black box catches your attention. Made of a material that seems to absorb the light around it, the box has no visible means of being opened—no lock, no hinge, nothing. Alchemist Ghalen leans in, his expression serious. "This box," he murmurs, "Magnus mentioned it once. It's protected by a magical ward that can only be bypassed by speaking a specific phrase. Be cautious, for each incorrect attempt to open it will unleash a punitive backlash."

#### The Box's Warning:

DM: Engraved upon the box's surface, barely visible in the dim light, is a warning: "Speak the truth of my keeper's quest, thrice wrong, and pay the cost." It's clear that the phrase to open the box is intricately linked to Magnus's research or beliefs, something that he would consider the core truth of his work.

#### Mechanic for the Phrase Attempt:

- **Players have 3 attempts** to guess the correct phrase to open the box.
- **Each incorrect attempt** results in a magical discharge, dealing 10 points of damage to the party or the individual attempting to open it.
- **Hint:** The correct phrase is hidden within the decoded messages from the journal entries you deciphered earlier. It relates directly to Magnus's ultimate goal or discovery.

#### The Correct Phrase:

Pursuit of Lost Knowledge is to illuminate the dark, not to dwell within it

#### Opening the Box:

DM: As you stand before the box, pondering the correct phrase, recall the essence of Magnus's work and beliefs. His research into the ethereal energy and his opposition to the Duke's plans might guide you to the answer. Speak your guess aloud, with caution.

- **If the players guess correctly** on their first three tries, describe how the box clicks open, revealing its contents without harm.
- **If they guess incorrectly,** narrate the consequences of the magical backlash, emphasizing the importance of understanding Magnus's work and intentions.

#### Inside the Box:

Once opened, the box could contain items of significant value, both materially and to the storyline. This might include:

- A key to the hidden laboratory in the old mines.
- A fragment of ethereal crystal, pulsing with contained energy.
- Personal notes from Magnus, providing further insight into his research and potential weaknesses of the Duke's planned weaponization.****
- [[SPELL SCROLL]]

## ASSAIN EVENT

As the group prepares to leave, planning their next move to confront the Duke's nefarious plans at the old mines, the air shifts. A chill runs down your spine as the faintest sound—a whisper of movement, a shadow against shadow—alerts you to danger. Without warning, an assassin, cloaked in darkness, materializes from the shadows, his eyes fixed on Ghalen.

#### The Attack:

Before anyone can react, the assassin strikes, a blade of pure shadow in his hand. Ghalen, caught off-guard, falls, a grievous wound across his chest and then cuts off Ghalen event. As he collapses, the assassin turns to you, a sinister smile playing on his lips. "The Duke sends his regards," he hisses.

#### Event: Combat with the Assassin

- **Initiative Roll:** Players must roll for initiative, determining the order of combat.
- **Assassin's Abilities:**
    - **Shadow Step:** Can teleport between shadows, making him difficult to pin down if its 1.
    - **Poisoned Blade:** 
	    - HEADS: His attacks deal an 5d6 poison damage on a hit 
	    - TAILS: HIS ATTACK DOES 2d6 Poison Damage
    -  45 health
- **Setting:** The cramped quarters of the office, filled with furniture and fragile objects, can be used strategically by both the players and the assassin.

#### Objectives:

1. **Avenge Ghalen:** The immediate objective is to defeat the assassin, avenging Ghalen's untimely death.
2. **Survive:** This assassin is a formidable foe, sent by the Duke to stop you from foiling his plans. Surviving this encounter is crucial.
3. **Gather Information:** If possible, capturing the assassin or finding clues on his person about the Duke's plans could be invaluable.

#### Combat Dynamics:

- Players will need to navigate the assassin's mobility and deadly attacks while making use of the environment.
- Encourage creative tactics, such as using spells to illuminate shadows, thereby limiting the assassin's mobility, or utilizing alchemical items found in the office for makeshift traps or weapons.
- If the players manage to corner the assassin or inflict significant damage, consider allowing a moment where the assassin might offer information in exchange for his life, adding a moral decision to the encounter.




[THE ESCAPE]

DM: As you, still wearing the guise of Professor Ghalen, cautiously proceed through the castle's secretive corridors, you're suddenly stopped by a guard. This isn't any ordinary guard; his eyes gleam with cunning and intelligence. He's known for challenging passersby with his riddles, believing that a sharp mind is the kingdom's best defense. Today, he seems particularly interested in you, mentioning a recent editorial that harshly criticized the Duke, accusing him of corruption and plotting against the King.

#### The Guard's Riddling Test:

Guard: "Ah, Professor Ghalen, just the man I hoped to see. This editorial, it's caused quite the stir within the castle walls. The author's courage to speak against the Duke has earned both my respect and suspicion. But let's see if your intellect matches your reputation. Solve my riddle, and I might just believe you're who you say you are."

#### The Riddle:

Guard: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

#### Objective:

- **Solve the Riddle:** The player must correctly solve the guard's riddle to maintain their disguise as Professor Ghalen and avoid raising suspicion.
- **Answer:** An "Echo."

#### If the Player Answers Correctly:

Guard: (Nods appreciatively) "Impressive, Professor. Your intellect remains as sharp as ever. It's a rare thing to find another who values the power of knowledge. Proceed, but remember, the truth always finds a way to echo through these halls."

#### If the Player Answers Incorrectly or Fails to Answer:

Guard: (Narrows his eyes) "Curious... I would have thought such a riddle to be child's play for the esteemed Professor Ghalen. Perhaps the rumors have overstated your acumen, or maybe... you're not who you appear to be."

#### Consequences of Failure:

- The guard becomes suspicious and might detain the player for further questioning, complicating the mission.
- Alternatively, the player might have to quickly concoct a believable excuse or find another way to distract or disarm the guard's suspicions, possibly through persuasion, bribery, or another quick-thinking solution.

#### Conclusion:

This encounter tests not just the player's ability to solve a riddle but also their capacity to think quickly under pressure, maintain their disguise, and navigate the political tensions within the castle. Successfully bypassing the guard allows the player to delve deeper into the castle's


#### Leading to Magnus's Location:

DM: With the code they recieved from the assiasns body and the ensignia they must first crack the code, the entries point to the old mines as a significant location. Not only is it the site of a hidden research lab, but it also appears to be where the Duke plans to weaponize Magnus's discoveries. Time is of the essence to thwart these plans and potentially rescue Magnus.

**[The scenario sets the stage for the next adventure, leading the players to the old mines to confront the Duke's schemes and uncover the truth behind Magnus's disappearance.]**


# [[MURDER OF LAURA]]

I am currently in the process of creating the next chapter of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. The players, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong, have just failed to interrogate the assassin, but they were able to get his stuff, which included a coded message, a ring with the royal family insignia, a poison dagger, and glass vials. Now in the next event, the players must first go to a safe place as police are currently suspicious of Kairon for killing the assassin.  They must decode the message which will inform them that the mines are a mysterious place that move and shift and without a map they will get lost in trying to find the person. To acquire the map there is a royal room where the map and other maps is stored in the dukes royal place although its quite hidden to find this they need to explore the alchemist society's secret headquarters but to find this head quarters they must.
