In the realm of shadows and whispers, there lies a dungeon known only to the brave and the foolish as the Twilight Dungeon. Legend speaks of an ancient chest, filled with treasures untold, guarded by the remnants of those who once sought its riches. Two adventurers, drawn by the lure of wealth and glory, stand at the threshold of darkness. Their quest: to delve into the depths, face the horrors within, and claim the chest. But the dungeon is not unguarded. Skeletons, ghouls, and the formidable guardian, a colossal dragon skeleton, stand between them and their prize.

#### Setting

The Twilight Dungeon is located in a forsaken part of the land, where the sun hesitates to shine, and the moon casts eerie shadows. The entrance is marked by ancient runes, warning all who seek to enter of the peril they face. Inside, the dungeon is a labyrinth of corridors and chambers, dimly lit by torches that seem to burn with a ghostly fire.

#### Objective

The players must navigate the dungeon, defeat the monsters within, and retrieve the ancient chest. They must work together, using their unique skills and abilities to overcome the challenges they face

#### Enemies

- **Skeletons (CR 1/4):** These animated bones are armed with rusty swords and tattered shields. They are the first line of defense, patrolling the corridors and chambers.
- **Ghouls (CR 1):** These once-human creatures now hunger for the flesh of the living. They are faster and more cunning than the skeletons, attacking with sharp claws and a paralyzing gaze.
- **Dragon Skeleton (CR 5):** The final guardian of the chest, this massive skeleton has been animated by dark magic. It retains the fearsome breath weapon of its living form, capable of unleashing a devastating blast of necrotic energy.

#### Mechanics

- The dungeon is designed for two players. Adjust the number of enemies accordingly to keep the challenge balanced.
- Monster HP is kept relatively low to ensure the sidequest remains fast-paced and manageable for a duo:
    - **Skeletons:** 300 HP each
	    - Attack damage: None
    - **Ghouls:** 22 HP each
	    - Attack Damage: 5 hp if prime number rolled
	    - Attack Damage: 10 Hp if role is 6
    - **Dragon Skeleton:** 50 HP
	    - Attack Damage: 12 HP
    These values can be adjusted based on the players' levels and abilities to maintain a fair challenge.
