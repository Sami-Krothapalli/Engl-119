Upon being teleported to Room 5, the players find themselves in a square chamber resembling an open art gallery. The walls are adorned with twenty numbered portraits, each with a button below its plaque. In the center stand two statues of soldiers in ornate armor, poised with spears and shields.

You see on the ground

"Through these doors, a silent tread, Invites the guardian's steely dread. Raise your voice, let sound be your friend, Or face the wrath these sentinels send. Ten beats of heart, the time does lend, Speak up quick, or meet your end."

if not awnserd all doors will lock

1. **Portrait Buttons:**
    
    - The room functions as an art gallery with twenty sequentially numbered portraits, each with a button underneath.
    -
2. **Deactivating the Statues:**
    
    - To prevent the statues from attacking (or to deactivate them if they have started), players must press the buttons under the portraits in the correct sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, then 16 and state what the pattern is.
    - This sequence corresponds to the powers of two, reflecting the puzzle's title, "Two is the Key."
3. **Sequence and Consequences:**
    
    - Pressing a button out of sequence or the wrong button will cause the statues to react aggressively. They gain an extra turn immediately after the incorrect button is pressed, moving at double speed and targeting the offending player.
    - This enhanced attack from the statues can occur only once per round. If another wrong button is pressed in the same round, the statues do not get another extra turn.
5. **Re-entry Mechanism:**

    - If players exit and re-enter the room, they must announce their presence again within ten seconds to prevent reactivation of the trap.


## CONCLUSION
Once the players successfully beat the puzzle by pressing the buttons beneath the portraits in the correct sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and manage to announce their presence within the required time, the following events unfold:

1. **Statues Deactivate:** The ornately armored statues, which had come to life as formidable adversaries, cease their attack. Their movement halts abruptly, and they return to their original positions, resuming their state as inanimate statues.
    
2. **Doors Unlock:** The previously sealed doors of the room magically unlock and open, signaling that the puzzle has been solved and the threat neutralized. The room, once a trap-laden gallery, now stands as a harmless passageway.
    
3. **Atmospheric Change:** The room's hostile ambiance dissipates, replaced by a calm stillness. The tension in the air vanishes, leaving behind a sense of accomplishment and relief among the players.
