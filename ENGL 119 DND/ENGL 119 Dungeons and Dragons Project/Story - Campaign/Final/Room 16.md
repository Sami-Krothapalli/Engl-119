The players enter Room 16, facing a daunting setup: a sealed burn room with steel walls and an unbreakable glass window. Through this window, they can see a delicate tumbler circuit within a glass orb, threatening to ignite the room with arcane flames if disturbed.

****Puzzle Description:**

- The burn room contains a tumbler circuit suspended in a glass orb, crucial for triggering an arcane flame trap.
- Electrical interaction with the circuit, either by increasing or decreasing the voltage, will activate the trap.
- Physical disturbances, such as picking locks or tampering with the door, can also trigger the flames.
- A brass tube injects fluid into the orb, linked to a mechanical pump. Tampering with this setup without precision could activate the trap.
- The room has an anti-magic barrier on one wall, while the other walls are steel but not magic-proof.
- Pressure plates in the floor and noise sensitivity in the burn room add to the complexity of disarming the trap.

1. **Observation:**
    
    - The room is sealed with a steel wall and has a small unbreakable glass window.
    - Inside, you see a glass orb suspended near the ceiling, containing a tumbler circuit.
    - Electrical changes or vibrations, such as opening the door incorrectly, will trigger the flame trap.
2. **Mechanisms:**
    
    - Two access panels in the antechamber connect to the electrical system.
    - A brass tube and mechanical pump system control the fluid in the orb.
    - The pump can either add to or remove fluid from the orb, affecting the trap's state.


**Caution:**

- Avoid unnecessary vibrations or noise as they might trigger the trap.
- The antechamber's anti-magic barrier only covers one wall; other walls are non-magical but sturdy.
- Incorrect interaction with the room’s elements, like tampering with the lock or walls, may activate the trap.


**Objective:** You need to safely enter the burn room without triggering the flame trap activated by a tumbler circuit within a glass orb.



**Hints for Players:**

- Focus on the brass tube and pump mechanism; it’s integral to the trap's operation and disarming.
- Consider the electrical circuitry and how forming a human chain might neutralize the threat.
- Investigate non-magical means to bypass the steel walls or to disarm the trap without triggering it.**

**Note to Players:** Careful analysis, cautious interaction with the environment, and precise actions are crucial to solving this puzzle and gaining access to the burn room without activating the deadly trap. Teamwork and intelligent use of resources will be your best assets.

1. **Chemical Neutralization:**
    
    - Use the pump to introduce a specific chemical into the orb, causing a reaction that turns the fluid into a non-threatening gel, thus neutralizing the trap.
    - This method requires knowledge of the right chemical and precise quantity to avoid setting off the trap.
2. **Human Circuit Formation:**
    
    - Open the access panels and form a human chain to short-circuit the trap safely.
    - Each participant in the chain will suffer 2d6 lightning damage but successfully disarming the trap showcases effective teamwork.
