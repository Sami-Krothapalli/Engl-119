**Event: Paired Progress**

The players enter a grand corridor, its length and breadth marked by an expanse of tiled flooring at its center. The tiles are decorated with faces, most twisted in expressions of horror, while a select few are a distinct color, showing faces of relief or joy.

**Puzzle Mechanics:**

- **Initial Observation:** The players notice the different styles of tiles and may deduce that the joyfully depicted tiles signify safety. The horror-faced tiles, more abundant, suggest danger.
    
- **Triggering the Trap:** If a player steps on a horror-faced tile, hidden turrets at the far end of the corridor unleash a volley of poisoned flechettes. This trap endangers everyone in the corridor, not just those on the tiled section.
    
- **Survival Checks:** Affected players must make a Dexterity saving throw to dodge the flechettes, taking 1d6 piercing damage on a fail, and then a Strength saving throw against the poison, risking 3d10 poison damage and the poisoned condition for 30 minutes. Success on the Strength save halves the poison damage and avoids the poisoned condition.
    
- **Safe Passage:** The relief-faced tiles are safe, but only while paired. This means one player must remain on a safe tile until another reaches the next safe tile. Moving off a safe tile without another being occupied triggers the trap.
    

**Strategy for Crossing:** Players must "leapfrog" from one safe tile to the next, ensuring that at any given moment, one of them is on a safe tile to prevent the activation of the trap.

**End of the Corridor:** At the corridor's end, beyond the tiled section, is a large button tile adorned with a happy face. This could be presumed to end the trap, but keen observation may reveal a smaller, unadorned button beside it:

- **Primary Button:** Pressing the large, adorned button might seem to end the trap, but it could potentially trigger the trap once more as a final test or deception.
    
- **True Disengagement:** The smaller, unadorned button is the actual mechanism to disarm the trap permanently. Perceptive players who notice and press this button can safely disarm the trap mechanism, ensuring no further threats from the corridor.
