The room is stark, save for a fountain built into the far wall, featuring a statue of a bearded man from whose mouth water flows. Beside the fountain rest two vessels, one smaller with the Roman numeral "III" and a larger one marked with a "V." The statue's outstretched hand, marked with a "IV," forms a small platform.

**Trigger Mechanism:** Upon entering the room, the players inadvertently activate a pressure plate or magical sensor, causing a steel portcullis to crash down, sealing the entrance. The room's walls ominously begin to inch closer, initiating a claustrophobic countdown.

**The Puzzle:** To halt the impending doom, players must place exactly four units (gallons or liters) of water on the statue’s hand. They must figure out how to achieve this using the three-unit and five-unit vessels provided.

**Solutions:**

1. **First Solution:**
    
    - Fill the five-unit vessel and use it to fill the three-unit vessel, leaving two units in the five-unit vessel.
    - Empty the three-unit vessel, then transfer the remaining two units from the five-unit vessel into the three-unit vessel.
    - Refill the five-unit vessel and use it to top off the three-unit vessel, leaving exactly four units in the five-unit vessel.
2. **Second Solution:**
    
    - Fill the three-unit vessel and pour its contents into the five-unit vessel.
    - Refill the three-unit vessel and pour as much as possible into the five-unit vessel, leaving one unit in the three-unit vessel.
    - Empty the five-unit vessel, then transfer the one unit from the three-unit vessel into the five-unit vessel.
    - Refill the three-unit vessel and pour its contents into the five-unit vessel, achieving the required four units.

**Disengagement:** Upon successfully measuring out and placing the four units of water onto the statue’s hand, the menacing walls halt their advance, and the portcullis lifts, freeing the players from the imminent threat. The room, once a trap, now stands silent, its puzzle solved and its secret revealed.

**Event Narrative:** This event not only tests the players' ability to solve mathematical puzzles under pressure but also adds a layer of tension and urgency with the threat of physical danger. Solving the puzzle not only requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills but also demands quick action to prevent a crushing demise, reinforcing the theme of weighing one's worth against the challenge presented.
