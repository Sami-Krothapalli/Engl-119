**Event in Room 31:**

As the players enter Room 31, a chilling aura envelops them. Before their eyes, the air shimmers and tears, revealing the fearsome form of the Demogorgon, Prince of Demons. Its two heads snarl in unison, and its gaze fills the air with palpable dread.

"Behold, adventurers, the mighty Demogorgon!" the GM announces. "You stand at a critical crossroads: face this formidable foe and reap the rewards of victory, or flee to seek another path, leaving the terror of the abyss behind. Should you triumph over this demon lord, a portal will appear, offering instant passage to Room 5, where the next clue in your quest awaits."

**Choice:**

- Fight the Demogorgon for a chance to teleport directly to the next Riddle Room.
- Flee to another room and avoid the confrontation, continuing the adventure through a different path.
