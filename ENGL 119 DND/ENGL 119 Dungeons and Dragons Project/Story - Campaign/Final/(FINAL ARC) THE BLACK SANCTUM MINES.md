**GM (setting the scene):** "You stand in the vibrant city square of Xandar, the gateway to the perilous Black Sanctum Mines. The air is filled with the sounds of bartering merchants, gossiping townsfolk, and the distant clatter of wagon wheels on cobblestones. Your task is clear: make your way to the Black Sanctum Mines."

**Player Interaction:** The players must now take the initiative to interact with the NPCs in the square to gather information about reaching the mines.

**Kairon (to an NPC):** "Excuse me, we’re looking to find our way to the Black Sanctum Mines. Can you help us?"

**NPC (responding):** "Oh, the Black Sanctum Mines? You'll need a guide for that journey. It’s no place to wander unaided. Look for Old Garrick, the seasoned guide; he’s your best bet. You’ll find him usually by the tavern, mapping out routes for adventurers."

**Sum Ting Wong (approaching Old Garrick):** "Are you Garrick? We need a guide to the Black Sanctum Mines. What’s your price?"

**Old Garrick (the guide):** "Aye, that’d be me. The mines, eh? Dangerous place, that. It’ll cost you 120 gold coins to have me take you there."

**Player (haggling with Garrick):** "That seems steep. How about we settle for 100 gold coins instead?"

From this point, the players can negotiate with Garrick, leveraging their skills and the situation to potentially reduce the price. This interaction allows them to actively engage with the world and its characters, setting the stage for their journey to the mines.

## DOORWAY ENTRANCE:

**GM (narrating the journey to the mines):** "With Old Garrick leading the way, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong traverse the rugged landscapes that skirt the outskirts of Xandar. The journey is long and fraught with the whispered threats of the unknown, but eventually, the trio stands before the Black Sanctum Mines. Before them looms a gigantic, dark, and eerie door, its surface pulsing with green flames that cast ghostly shadows on the surrounding rocks."

**GM (describing the puzzle door):** "Upon closer inspection, you notice four knockers on the door, arranged in a square. The top left knocker bears a Roman numeral 'I,' the top right 'II,' the bottom right 'III,' and the bottom left 'IV.' Above the knockers, a small brass plaque displays an intricate diagram of the golden ratio, its spiral unmarked yet clearly significant. The arrangement whispers of a sequence, a pattern waiting to be unlocked." On the door there is a small paragraph that reeds as follows:

"In nature's grasp, a sequence lies,  
Where each new term, before your eyes,  
Sum of the last, two it combines,  
From simple starts, to complex lines.

First a single, then one more,  
Add them up, to get the score.  
Two now follows, in this dance,  
Three and five enhance the chance.

What am I, with growth so neat,  
In petals, shells, and spirals meet?"



**GM (introducing the puzzle):** "As Garrick stands back, murmuring warnings of the door’s rumored defenses, you realize that this is no ordinary entrance. The sequence to open it must be precise.


### PUZZLE SOLUTION: 
**Puzzle Solution:** Players should knock on the knockers following the Fibonacci sequence: starting with the second knocker, then the third, and the fourth one twice, representing the sequence 1, 1, 2.


**GM (on incorrect attempts):** "Should you knock incorrectly, the chosen knocker's emblem glows ominously. A poisoned spine suddenly shoots out, aiming to pierce the hand that erred (allowing for a high DC Dexterity save to avoid the immediate piercing damage). Regardless of the physical evasion, the toxic effect is potent, necessitating a Constitution save to resist or suffer 4d10 poison damage, with half damage on a successful save."



## ENTER BLACK SANCTUM MINES:

**GM (upon successful completion):** "As the correct sequence concludes with the second knock on the 'IV' knocker, the green flames intensify, then extinguish, as if bowing to the correct answer. The massive door emits a low groan and swings open, revealing a shifting corridor that extends into the heart of the mines. As you step over the threshold, the map in your hands trembles, then morphs, displaying new paths and numbers, hinting at the mutable nature of the Black Sanctum Mines ahead."

This setup not only challenges the players’ problem-solving skills but also introduces them to the dynamic and dangerous environment of the Black Sanctum Mines, setting the tone for the adventures and trials that lie within.

## EVENTS AND PATHWAYS

Players made it to room 1 -> then got teleported after a coulple of events to room 28 where they got some loot and went to fight the Lich after the fighting the lich the went to room 3 where they foaught the ancient dragon


The players got teleported to room 17 


## Room 17

**GM's Description:**

"As you materialize in Room 17, your eyes are drawn to an imposing staircase of 20 steps ascending into shadow. The air carries a hint of danger, mixed with the stale scent of ancient mechanisms long unused. Each stone riser gleams ominously, hinting at hidden perils. At the base of the stairs, a plaque bears a riddle, its letters shimmering with an arcane glow."

**GM's Riddle:**


> [!Riddle] RIDDLE
> "Alone they stand, not in a pair or square,  
In line they march, quite solitary and rare.  
From two they start, no others share their bed,  
Seek their path, where few dare tread."


**GM's Challenge:**

"The riddle before you suggests a hidden logic to these stairs, a puzzle demanding insight and caution.  The ordinary steps hold danger, ready to transform the staircase into a treacherous slide, ending in a bed of spikes below which will deal 3d8 bludgeoning and 3d10 piercing damage if you aren't saved by the saving through . Can you decipher the riddle and navigate the 

AWNSER: Stairs by stepping only on the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19?"

**Player Interaction:**

- **Deciphering the Riddle:** "The riddle speaks of solitary numbers, distinct and integral. Which of you will unravel its meaning and guide your steps according to the logic of primes?"
    
- **Navigating the Trap:** "Tell me, with each cautious step, which riser do you choose, trusting in the riddle's cryptic guidance?"
    
- **Mistake and Consequence:** "If your foot lands on a false step, the mechanism triggers with a chilling click. The stairs slicken and begin to tilt! A swift Dexterity saving throw is required to escape the slide toward the spike trap, threatening with harsh bludgeoning and piercing damage."
    

**Conclusion:**

"Success in this puzzle not only proves your wisdom but also your bravery. As the final prime number is stepped upon, the mechanical groaning of the stairs ceases, and the way forward becomes clear. The illusion of the room fades, like fog under the morning sun,
