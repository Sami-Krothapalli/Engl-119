[[Rogue Alchemist]]

### Description of the City of Xander

The city of Xander, shrouded in mystery and intellect, is a haven for scholars and alchemists. Governed by Duke Drole, it is a place where knowledge and discovery hold the highest value. The city's crowning jewel is Xander's Alchemist Society, renowned for its groundbreaking advancements in alchemy. The society's influence permeates the city, with intricate devices and alchemical symbols adorning the streets and buildings.

Recently, the disappearance of a prominent member of the Alchemist Society has plunged the city into a state of high alert. Whispers and rumors fill the air as scholars and citizens alike speculate on the cause of this sudden vanishing.

The Alchemist Society's headquarters, while known to many in reputation, remains an enigma in location. Hidden in plain sight or tucked away in a labyrinth of alleys, its true whereabouts are a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few.

## SIDE QUEST: Xandor's City Dungeon

### [[TWILIGHT DUNGEON]]


### Script: Encounter with Elara and the Letter of Concern

As you are the treasures from the Twilight Dungeon, are on their way back to the bustling city of Xandor. The sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows across the road. As they approach the city gates, they spot a familiar face waiting by the roadside - Elara, their old city tour guide, a middle-aged man with keen eyes and a friendly demeanor, known for his extensive knowledge of Xandor's history and secrets.

**Elara**: (Waving them over with a mixture of urgency and relief in his eyes) "Ah, my friends! Fortune smiles upon me to have crossed paths with you again. But I fear this meeting is under less than fortunate circumstances. as I have information regarding your rogue alchemists friend Magnus"

(Lowering his voice, he hands them a sealed letter) "This arrived for me just days ago, intended for someone I believe you've had dealings with - the rogue alchemist, known in scholarly circles as Magnus Verdant. Tall, dresses like a scholar with a penchant for purple and red, and those striking blue eyes. A master of magical alchemy, his work has stirred both awe and controversy."

**The Letter**: (you open the letter, they see it's written with a meticulous hand, the ink a dark hue reminiscent of dried blood. The letterhead bears the insignia of the Alchemic Guild, and it's signed by Professor Alaric Ghalen, a name known to few outside the highest echelons of magical study. Ghalen is described in the postscript as a venerable figure in alchemy, with a distinguished career dedicated to the study of Etheric Transmutations, a topic that has long eluded many.)

# [[LETTER]]
**Professor Alaric Ghalen's Letter**: 

My Dearest Magnus,

It has come to my attention, through whispers and shadows, that your recent paper on the 'Principles of Quintessential Conversion' has not only broken new ground but has also sown discord among our ranks. Your theories, though revolutionary, tread upon dangerous ground, touching the very essence of what many believe to be sacrosanct.

I remember, not long before your disappearance, seeing you engrossed in your work within the confines of my research lab. The fervor in your eyes was unmistakable; such dedication to your craft is rare and commendable. However, the night you vanished, the air was rent with the sounds of yelling and distressing screams - a cacophony that has haunted me since. I must inquire, for the sake of old camaraderie and the ethical bounds of our profession, are you well?

Your work, while controversial, holds the potential to reshape our understanding of the world. Yet, I fear it may also attract unwarranted attention specifically from the duke of Xandor, from those who seek to exploit or suppress it. I urge you to tread carefully, and remember our code as scholar's and furthermore as friend's: 'Pursuit of Lost Knowledge is to illuminate the dark, not to dwell within it.'

Should you find yourself in need of sanctuary or a confidant, you know the way to my door - 117 Verdure Lane, the house with the emerald knocker. Speak the words 'Through shadow, light; through chaos, order' to my doorkeeper, and you shall be welcomed.

In closing, I leave you with a caution and a guide: 'The brightest flame casts the darkest shadow.' May it serve you in times of doubt.

Yours in scholarship and concern, 
Alaric Ghalen


**Elara**: I knew not what to make of it, but given your recent endeavors, I thought it best it found its way to you. Magnus's work and disappearance have stirred much talk. It seems his paper on 'Principles of Quintessential Conversion'—a study on transforming base elements into their purest magical forms—has ruffled more than just academic feathers."

**Elara**: "Notice how Ghalen mentions the lab and the screams? It's said that Magnus was on the verge of a breakthrough that could change alchemy as we know it. And those words... codes, perhaps? They could be keys to unlocking his work or even finding him."  Professor Ghalen could be the key to figuring out where Magnus is.

Do You Choose to Head to Professors Ghalen's House?



# At Alchemist Ghalen's House
**Alchemist Ghalen:** (Opening the door) Ah, you must be the ones Elara mentioned. Please, come in. Time is of the essence, and I fear for what little of it we have left.

**Player 2:** (Entering the house) We're here about Magnus. What can you tell us about his disappearance?

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Magnus and I... we shared many ideas, but when it came to the Duke's proposal to weaponize our research, we stood united in our opposition. Magnus, however, took a step further, writing extensively on the Ethereal Convergence— a concept that could revolutionize our understanding of magic and alchemy.

**Player 1:** And you believe this research led to his disappearance?

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Undoubtedly. His work, while brilliant, attracted the wrong kind of attention. His last days at the university were tumultuous. Arguments... shouts in the night. Then silence. I fear he may have been taken, or worse, coerced into completing his research for nefarious purposes.

**Player 2:** You mentioned his research is still at the university?

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Yes, in his office. I've kept it hidden, away from prying eyes. I plan to go and investigate  it tonight, under the guise of late-night research. I could use your assistance. The path there isn't straightforward—traps, both magical and mundane, guard the halls. But with your help, we might just retrieve it and perhaps find a clue to where Magnus has been taken.

**Player 1:** What kind of traps are we talking about? How can we avoid them?

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Magnus was a master of his craft. He favored puzzles that challenge the mind. "Only those who understand the essence of alchemy can pass," he often said. Look for the symbols of the four elements; they're key to bypassing the first layer of protection. As for the rest, Magnus believed in the balance of nature—remember that. It may very well save your lives.

**Player 2:** We're ready when you are. Let's find this research and save Magnus.

**Alchemist Ghalen:** Excellent. I'll prepare what's necessary. Meet me at the back entrance of the university in an hour. And remember, discretion is paramount. We must not attract the Duke's attention.
