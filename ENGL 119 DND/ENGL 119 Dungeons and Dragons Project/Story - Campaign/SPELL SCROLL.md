#### Unlocking the Spell:

To unlock the spell, the players must solve a riddle contained within the scroll. The riddle plays on the themes of light and darkness, integral to the spell's nature.

#### The Riddle:

_"I am a child of light, yet I dwell in the dark.  
The brighter the source, the deeper I mark.  
Bound to my maker, yet I roam free,  
Invisible in darkness, in light, you see me.  
I grow with the day and fade at night's call,  
In the presence of light, I am nothing at all.  
What am I?"

#### Solution:

The answer to the riddle is **"A Shadow."** Shadows are created by light but exist in darkness, symbolizing both an end (to light) and a beginning (the presence of an object blocking the light).

#### Reward for Solving the Riddle:

Upon correctly solving the riddle, a burst of ethereal flame envelops the scroll, leaving no burn marks but etching the spell into the minds of the players. As a bonus for their wisdom and insight, the players are instantly granted enough experience to advance to the next level, reflecting their deepened understanding of the magical forces at play.

#### Dungeon Master (DM) Guidance:

- **Introducing the Spell:** Describe the scroll's mysterious aura and the sensation of power it exudes. Let the players feel the weight of discovery as they unravel the secrets within.
- **Solving the Riddle:** Encourage the players to discuss and brainstorm the answer together, fostering a sense of teamwork and collaborative problem-solving.
- **Leveling Up:** Narrate the surge of power they feel upon solving the riddle, how the knowledge of the spell seems to imprint itself in their minds, and the immediate growth in their abilities.

This spell not only adds a new dynamic to the players' magical arsenal but also deepens their engagement with the game's mystical elements through the interactive challenge of the riddle.
