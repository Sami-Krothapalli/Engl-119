The game begins in the bustling streets near the university, where the players have just exited an alleyway with the assassin's belongings. The discovery of Professor Ghalen's body at the university causes an uproar, followed by the chilling discovery of Laura’s body, the alchemist Magnus's wife.


**GAME MASTER** : As you step out of the shadowed alley, clutching the assassin's coded message and poison-laden tools, the air is suddenly pierced by a scream. Rushing to the source, you find a crowd encircling Laura's lifeless form outside the alchemist's abode. Panic and suspicion swirl through the onlookers as the city guards begin to question everyone nearby, including you."

**Guard Asks you:** Hold there! Many eyewitness have stated that you two have been seen conversing with both Laura and Ghalen, both now found dead under mysterious circumstances. What business did you have with them?"

**Guard Captain:** "Their deaths were no accident, and your presence at both scenes is more than a coincidence. However, without concrete proof, we’re just following leads. What were your conversations about?"


#### The tension is palpable when suddenly a cloaked figure steps through the crowd.

**Guild Representative (firmly to the guards):** "Enough! These individuals are under the protection of our guild. We have been monitoring the situation closely and can vouch for their whereabouts during the time of these tragic events."

**City Guard (skeptically):** "And who are you to interrupt official city business? Can you prove their innocence?"

**Guild Representative (revealing a badge with the guild's insignia):** "I am here on behalf of the guild. Not only can we attest to their innocence, but we also believe they are crucial in solving these heinous crimes. Interfering with their work will only delay justice for the victims."

**City Guard (reluctantly):** "Very well, the guild has always been a... reliable ally. But we will be watching closely."

(The guards step back, allowing the representative to speak privately with Kairon and Sum Ting Wong.)

**Guild Representative (to Kairon and Sum Ting Wong):** "Apologies for the interruption. We've been following your progress and are impressed by your skills. The city is in turmoil, and it's clear that we need your expertise to navigate this crisis. this murder is cloaked in mystery and intrigue, demand our immediate attention. "You've proven yourselves capable under pressure. We need you to delve into these murders, find the connections, and unmask the killer. We believe this is part of a larger plot that threatens the very fabric of our city. We are prepared to offer you each 20 gold coins and 500 experience points upon the successful resolution of this case.."

Guild Representee I suggest going to the crime scene and speaking with the gaurds as well as the civillians gathered there as I suspect the killer might still be there



#### Types of Witnesses

- **Uninformed Witnesses:** These individuals offer fragmented or irrelevant details but can provide environmental or emotional context.
    
    **GM (as an Uninformed Witness):** "I... I saw nothing, sirs. Just heard the screams, I did. Everyone was running... But, wait, maybe... No, no, nothing important, I'm sure."
    
- **Misleading Witnesses:** They complicate the investigation with incorrect or biased information.
    
    **GM (as a Misleading Witness):** "I heard she had enemies, that Laura. People in dark cloaks, always lurking. Saw one by the tavern last night, I did. Had the look of a killer, he did!"
    
- **Informed Witnesses:** These individuals possess crucial information that can piece together the events leading to the murders.
    
    **GM (as an Informed Witness):** "I saw Laura arguing with a strange man by the university gates. He wore a signet ring, similar to... Oh dear, the one you're holding!"
    
- **Killer Witness (the murderer):** Disguised as an informed witness, he tries to mislead the players subtly.
    
    **GM (as the Killer Witness, subtly hinting guilt):** "Yes, a tragic event. I saw Laura often, poor soul. Always kind to everyone, even strangers. I just... (pauses, looking down) wish I could have helped her. But what can a simple merchant do, right?


#### Files:

ONLY IF ASKED
#### Autopsy Report: Laura

---

**Autopsy Report File No.:** 0824-LA

**Victim:** Laura, Age 34

**Examiner:** Dr. Elia Hornwright

**Date of Examination:** 10th Day of Harvestmonth

**Time of Examination:** Just after dusk

---

#### External Examination:

The deceased is a 34-year-old female. Body length is 5 feet 6 inches, and weight is approximately 130 pounds. No significant external injuries were observed except for a small puncture wound located on the right side of the neck.

---

#### Internal Examination:

**Head and Neck:**

- No cranial fractures or brain injuries noted.
- The neck shows a puncture wound approximately 2 mm in diameter.
- Surrounding tissue discoloration suggests the injection of a foreign substance.

**Chest and Abdomen:**

- No internal injuries or abnormalities detected.
- Lungs exhibit signs of severe edema and hemorrhage, indicative of respiratory failure.

**Toxicology Report:**

- Analysis of blood samples reveals the presence of a potent neurotoxic compound, resembling characteristics of refined nightshade extract.
- The substance likely induced asphyxiation through respiratory paralysis.

---

#### Conclusion:

The cause of death is determined to be respiratory failure due to neurotoxic poisoning. The method of poison delivery appears to be a small, precise injection through the neck, likely administered with a narrow-bladed instrument, possibly a dagger. The absence of struggle marks and the precise nature of the wound suggest the victim was taken by surprise.

---

#### Notes:

- The sophisticated method of assassination and the use of refined poison suggest the perpetrator is well-versed in the art of killing and possibly has access to rare and deadly substances.
- Further investigation is required to trace the origin of the poison and identify potential suspects with knowledge or access to such toxins.****



ASSASING FIGHT BEGINS!!!

"As the guards escort the handcuffed assassin through the crowded square, a cold glint of determination flashes in his eyes. With a swift, unexpected movement, he breaks from their grasp, shouting, 'Death to all enemies and adversaries of Magnus!' Before the guards can react, he lunges towards Kairon and Sum Ting Wong, blade drawn and eyes burning with malice."

**Assassin’s First Move**

- **GM:** "The assassin, with a burst of desperate strength, charges at you, dagger poised to strike. His first target is Kairon, attempting to stab at him with a poisoned blade."
    
    (Assume the assassin rolls an attack; determine if it hits based on Kairon’s AC.)
### The Culmination

As the players interact with these witnesses, they should piece together the evidence. Observant players might notice the discrepancy in the Killer Witness's story or the bloodstains hidden beneath his cloak.

**GM (revealing the truth):** "As you press the merchant for details, a drop of crimson catches your eye, seeping from beneath his cloak. His facade cracks, revealing the panic of a cornered predator."

### Confrontation and Resolution

Upon successfully identifying and confronting the killer, players will find additional evidence linking him to the murders, including another coded message and high-quality assassin gear.

**GM (concluding the encounter):** "With the murderer apprehended, his cloak falls away to reveal the royal insignia on his attire, matching the ring you found earlier. Among his possessions, you discover another coded message and an array of finely crafted assassin tools."

Among the items you get:


1. **Wyvern Poison (Injury):** "Hidden in a false bottom of the assassin's satchel, you find a small, ornately carved vial containing a thick, dark green liquid. This is Wyvern Poison, one of the deadliest toxins known across the lands. Even a scratch laced with this venom can paralyze and torment its victim, leading to an agonizing demise unless countered with powerful magic."
	1. This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated [wyvern](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters:Wyvern?expansion=0#content). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    
2. **Nightshade's Whisper (Very Rare Weapon - Dagger):** "Beneath his cloak, strapped to the assassin's side, you discover a dagger that seems to absorb the light around it, casting an ominous aura. Named Nightshade's Whisper, this very rare weapon is forged from a mysterious alloy and coated with a perpetual layer of lethal poison. On a successful strike, it not only deals its base damage but also inflicts a devastating poison effect that deteriorates the victim’s health over time. Its hilt bears the emblem of a sinister, shadowed duck, aligning with the insignia you’ve encountered previously." [[http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:whisper]]

4. ** BLACK BOX**: Made of a smooth, dark material, it feels unnaturally cold to the touch. Intricate carvings adorn its surface, and a riddle is etched into the lid, promising to yield its secrets to those clever enough to decipher its words."

### The Riddle on the Black Box

"Two brothers we are, great burdens we bear, By which we are bitterly pressed. In truth, we may say, we are full all the day, But empty when we go to rest."

**GM (guiding the players):** "To unlock the box and claim its contents, you must solve the riddle. Take your time, think it over, and speak your answer aloud."

(If the players struggle, you can offer them hints or allow intelligence checks for additional clues.)

### Solution to the Riddle

The answer to the riddle is "Shoes."

**GM (upon solving the riddle):** "As you utter the word 'Shoes,' the black box emits a soft click. The lid springs open, revealing its precious contents. Nestled within a velvet lining is a vial filled with a vibrant, purple liquid."

### Reward: Purple Worm Poison

**GM (describing the item):** "This is Purple Worm Poison, a rare and deadly toxin extracted from the glands of a purple worm. It is known for its devastating potency and is used to coat weapons for an extra lethal strike."

	1. **Purple Worm Poison (Injury)**: This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated [Purple Worm](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Monsters:Purple%20Worm?expansion=0#content). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


- **Item:** Purple Worm Poison
- **Type:** Injury poison
- **Damage:** On a successful hit with a weapon coated with this poison, the target takes an additional 12d6 poison damage.
- **Effect:** If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
- 

**GM (concluding the discovery):** "With the riddle solved and the box’s secret unveiled, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong now possess a vial of Purple Worm Poison, a substance feared for its lethal effects. This rare item not only signifies the deadly lengths to which their foes will go but also serves as a powerful asset in the perilous journey ahead."

This scenario engages players with a mental challenge and rewards their success with a valuable and dangerous item, enriching the campaign's depth and offering new strategic options for future encounters.

[[Assassins Code]]

I am currently in the process of creating the next chapter of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. The players, Kairon and Sum Ting Wong, have just completed the side quest above and got both decoded messages from to assassins. Now in the next event, the players must first go to a safe place as police are currently suspicious of Kairon for killing the assassin.  They must decode the message which will inform them that the mines are a mysterious place that move and shift and without a map they will get lost in trying to find the person. To acquire the map there is a royal room where the map and other maps is stored in the dukes royal place although its quite hidden to find this they need to explore the alchemist society's secret headquarters but to find this head quarters they must.
