Alvarez named after the mage who founded the city is the magic capital of the Kingdom of Vale here you can find all sorts of assorted goods and magical items for your adventure that might be of value.

## [[Orario - The City of Trade]]
Orario is a majestic trade city that is great for finding all sorts of items, trinkets, and people. 
If you know the right people you can find anything in the world for the right price. Orario has very mysterious and alluding underground market to get rare never seen items before. But beware of this place as this also makes it a nest for illegal activity such as abduction, Slavery, and theft note that some of the items you see may not be what you expect and can come with some unwanted consequences. 

## [[Fafnir - City of Dragons]]
The largest of the cities, this city is dominated by the eight thousand-foot-high mountain known as the Earthspur which are home to a massive colony of dragons of varying sizes. This city is great if you want to get around fast as lower subdragons like wyverns are tamed and treated as pets and a unique form of transportation starting here will allow you to travel where ever you would like with ease. The main guild in this city is the Forgoon Guild .  Note that this city worships Asmodeous a Dragon God and as such most citizens speak dragoonian so communicating here will be a bit difficult your best bet is to find a Trader in the market that will sell you a rune of communication.
